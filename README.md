# Checkbox-Soundeffect Obsidian Plugin

Checkbox-Soundeffect is an Obsidian plugin that enhances your checkbox experience by playing a sound whenever you click a checkbox or toggle an inline boolean field. Make your note-taking and task management more interactive and engaging with sound effects.

## Supported Checklist Formats

The Checkbox-Soundeffect plugin currently supports the following checklist formats:

- Standard checkboxes
- Checkboxes in a numbered list
- Inline boolean values when integrated with the Better Inline Fields plugin

## Plugin Integration: Better Inline Fields

The Checkbox-Soundeffect plugin can integrate with the "Better Inline Fields" plugin to provide an even more immersive note-taking experience. Specifically, the third trigger event for sound effects can be set to work when you toggle inline boolean values (e.g., `Some Field:: false` to `Some Field:: true` and works with its checkbox feature).

**How to Enable Integration**

1. Make sure both the Checkbox-Soundeffect and Better Inline Fields plugins are installed and enabled.
2. Navigate to the Checkbox-Soundeffect settings and activate the "Enable Better Inline Fields Integration" option.
3. Configure your third sound effect trigger within the Checkbox-Soundeffect settings.

Now, when you toggle an inline boolean value using Better Inline Fields, the third sound effect will be triggered, adding an auditory layer to your interactions.

## Setup

To use the Checkbox-Soundeffect plugin, follow these steps:

1. **Upload Your Audio File**

   Before you start, make sure you have an MP3 audio file that you want to use as the sound effect. To upload the audio file, we recommend using Discord, but Telegram can also work.

   - **Discord:**
     - Join a server or create a new one if you don't have any.
     - Navigate to the text channel where you want to upload the audio file.
     - Drag and drop your MP3 audio file into the text channel.
     - Right-click the name of the uploaded MP3 (it will be a blue link).
     - Select "Copy Link" from the context menu.

2. **Change the Audio File URL in Plugin Settings**

   - Go to the Obsidian settings and navigate to the "Plugins" section.
   - Find the "Checkbox-Soundeffect" plugin and click on it to access its settings.
   - There will be a field to input the audio file URL. Paste the URL that you copied from Discord into this field.
   - Save the changes.

Now you're all set! Every time you click a checkbox in your Obsidian notes, you'll hear the sound effect you selected.
