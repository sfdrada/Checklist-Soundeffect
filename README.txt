# Checkbox-Soundeffect Obsidian Plugin

Checkbox-Soundeffect is an Obsidian plugin that enhances your checkbox experience by playing a sound whenever you click a checkbox. Make your note-taking and task management more engaging with this interactive sound feature.

## Setup

To use the Checkbox-Soundeffect plugin, follow these steps:

1. **Upload Your Audio File**

   Before you start, make sure you have an MP3 audio file that you want to use as the sound effect. To upload the audio file, we recommend using Discord, but Telegram can also work.

   - **Discord:**
     - Join a server or create a new one if you don't have any.
     - Navigate to the text channel where you want to upload the audio file.
     - Drag and drop your MP3 audio file into the text channel.
     - Right-click the name of the uploaded MP3 (it will be a blue link).
     - Select "Copy Link" from the context menu.

2. **Change the Audio File URL in Plugin Settings**

   - Go to the Obsidian settings and navigate to the "Plugins" section.
   - Find the "Checkbox-Soundeffect" plugin and click on it to access its settings.
   - There will be a field to input the audio file URL. Paste the URL that you copied from Discord into this field.
   - Save the changes.

Now you're all set! Every time you click a checkbox in your Obsidian notes, you'll hear the sound effect you selected.
